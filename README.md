# Python-Portfolio
 Create an interface for a portfolio web application. The main (index) page lists your projects including the project title and short description. Each project links to a detail page that displays the title, date, and description.  The application lets the user add or edit project information. When adding or editing a project, the application prompts the user for title, date, skills, description, and a link to a repo. The results for these entries are stored in a database and displayed on the homepage. The HTML/CSS for this site has been supplied for you.

Welcome to my Portfolio!

This project shows off some of my projects, practices, and finished tutorials, as well as showing you some of the skills I've learned during the course of the projects. I also include information about myself and ways to contact me. I also include a link to add projects, detailed links to each project where you can edit or delete them, and finally, I have a 404 page if people error out so that they don't error out.

To view the project, you'll need to download the files. I suggested cloning the repository and opening them up in VSCode.

When you open it, open up your terminal and create a virtual environment, activating it, and downloading the proper requirements.

For Windows you'll type:
- python -m venv env
- .\env\Scripts\activate
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- Then type python app.py to start the Flask server.

For Mac you'll type:
- python3 (or python(X) for whatever python you're using) -m venv env 	
- source .env/bin/activate
- pip3 (or pip(x) for for whatever pip you're using) install -r requirements.txt
- Then type python3 app.py

After that you can utilize your web browser and go to:
Localhost:8000 or 127.0.0.1:8000

Now you can see the project in action.

I had a lot of fun creating it, please let me know if you find any bugs!
